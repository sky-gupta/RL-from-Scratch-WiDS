## Week 1 Assignment

- The assignment in `week1.ipynb` is about simple modelling of some basic RL environment which is to help you understand the basic working of MDPs. Note that most problems we work with using RL always have a MDP working under the hood, which we may or may not(most of the times) know. We will explore this in later weeks

- The second is an **optional** reading assignment which you can read if you intreseted in understanding and modelling of **Markov chains** in detail. It also has two exercise questions whose solutions are given at the end. Note that it requires some basic understanding of **probability, expected value and ranodom variables** so its ok if you don't understand in the beginning. Although it is important that you google these terms to get a baisc idea if you don't know them , as it will be used frequently in RL.
